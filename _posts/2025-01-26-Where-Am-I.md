# What?
A modification for the game [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us), the Where Am I mod allows a player to modifiy the output of the game's F3 + C hotkey.

# Why?
The default output for this hotkey is sometimes less-than-ideal, depending on the player circumstances. I made the mod to allow users increased flexibility when it comes to the game. More broadly, I wanted to explore the world of game modifications, encouraging me to navigate new, specialised APIs, and take part in the modding community.

# How?
The modification is built specifically for the [Fabric toolchain](https://fabricmc.net/). It uses mappings and mixins to precisely inject code into the game, allowing the it to override typical game behaviour.
